        By relating this philosophy to even the smaller things in life you
        will realize that failure is everywhere. By realizing this you make
        failure seem not so scary anymore.

        Learn from you mistakes to help keep "forward momentum". This forward
        momentum works as a boost to help you to keep going! think about pushing
        a large heavy ball when it's stopped versus pushing it when it has already 
        started moving!

        Realize that by surrounding yourself with a support group that you are more
        likely to achieve your goals! Feed from positive energy from those around you
        and block out those who are trying to put you down while still learning from others
        constructive criticism.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
