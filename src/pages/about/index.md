### How the Growth philosophy started
The Growth philosophy was started when our founder was at home watching a baseball game. Over time the founder realized that a really good hitter only gets on base 30% of the time! That means they 
fail the other 70% of the time but how do they have the courage to go back up to the plate when they fail this much?

### Success can be mentally driven
Hall of Famer Yogi Berra once said "Baseball is 90 percent mental. The other half is physical." The growth philosphy takes this quote and relates it to real life. By staying positive you have a higher chance of achieving your goals.

### Supportive surrounding promote success
Baseball is a team game. Having supportive teammates can help you reach your goals. Think about being a pitcher and having good fielders to back you. A similar idea can be used when trying to achieve your goals. Pick good teammates.

### Feed from your passion
A lot of ballplayers don't play for the money but instead just for a love of the game. This helps them achieve their goals by actually enjoying what they're doing. By having a passion for what you are doing you are more likely to achieve your goals.
