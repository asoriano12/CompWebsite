  heading: Utilize Information
  description: >
    Information is a key part of success in the real world just like a batter utilizes
    information to get a hit. This also means that you might not be succesful on your first 
    try but that's okay. Multiple attempts are allowed in must cases in the real world just
    like you get mutiple at bats in baseball!
